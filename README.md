Beautiful chaos of Newtonian gravity

I was simulating gravity in Python and made some pictures. Each white dot is a fixed body with 1 unit of mass. Each point in the pictures is colored according to which body an object dropped from that point would collide with. If an object at some point didn't collide within a certain amount of time (or reached escape velocity away from the points) then that point was colored black. You can see there are regions that are incredibly sensitive to the initial location. Beautiful gravitational chaos.
